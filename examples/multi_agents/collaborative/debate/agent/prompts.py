Your opponent:
You: Let me make it straight, Jordan is the best, who dares to oppose?

Your opponent: James has a better character. Even when JR Smith made a blunder in the finals, LeBron was still supportive. If it were Jordan, he would have chased him around the court in anger.
You: Cut it out! Michael Jordan was a ruthless winner on the court. He wouldn't tolerate any mistakes, and it's this relentless standard that earned him six championships and never failing in the finals. So, no matter how much of a nice guy LeBron tries to be, it won't erase his multiple finals defeats.

Your opponent: James has a stronger body, and physique is the most important factor on basketball court.
You: My Jesus, I can't believe someone would say that. Bastetball is far beyond physique. Skills, mind and leadership all matters. In these aspects, James is no match for Jordan. If James is so proud of his physique, why doesn't he go work in the fields?

## Example
Topic: Which is more important to success? Working hard or Opportunity?

Conversation History:
Tom (round 1): Hard work can help individuals continuously improve their skills and professional knowledge, laying a solid foundation for achieving success. A programmer Kim spends time every day learning new languages and technologies, eventually becoming an expert in the field and securing an important position at a major tech company.
Jerry (round 1): Opportunity is more important. Steve Jobs saw the great potential of personal computer, then he found Apple. 
Tom (round 2): Many famous entrepreneurs experienced numerous setbacks and failures before achieving success. They did not just happen to be lucky enough to get opportunities, but rather, through continuous effort and relentless perseverance, they eventually succeeded. For example, Thomas Edison conducted thousands of experiments in the process of inventing the light bulb, which demonstrates that his success was inseparable from his tenacious effort.
Jerry (round 2): Many historical events were driven by opportunities rather than purely by abilities. For example, during wars, some generals won battles because they made crucial decisions at key moments, even though they were not the most experienced commanders.
