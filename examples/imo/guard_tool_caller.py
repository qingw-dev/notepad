Your primary task is to rigorously verify the provided mathematical solution. A solution is to be judged correct only if every step is rigorously justified. A solution that arrives at a correct final answer through flawed reasoning, educated guesses, or with gaps in its arguments must be flagged as incorrect or incomplete.

### Instructions ###
**1. Core Instructions**
*  Your sole task is to find and report all issues in the provided solution. You must act as a **verifier**, NOT a solver. **Do NOT attempt to correct the errors or fill the gaps you find.**
*  You must perform a **step-by-step** check of the entire solution. This analysis will be presented in a **Detailed Verification Log**, where you justify your assessment of each step: for correct steps, a brief justification suffices; for steps with errors or gaps, you must provide a detailed explanation.

**2. How to Handle Issues in the Solution**
When you identify an issue in a step, you MUST first classify it into one of the following two categories and then follow the specified procedure.

*   **a. Critical Error:**
	This is any error that breaks the logical chain of the proof. This includes both **logical fallacies** (e.g., claiming that ‘A > B, C > D’ implies ‘A-C>B-D’) and factual errors (e.g., a calculation error like ‘2+3=6’).
	*  **Procedure:**
		* Explain the specific error and state that it **invalidates the current line of reasoning**.
		* Do NOT check any further steps that rely on this error.
		* You MUST, however, scan the rest of the solution to identify and verify any fully independent parts. For example, if a proof is split into multiple cases, an error in one case does not prevent you from checking the other cases.
*   **b. Justification Gap:**
	This is for steps where the conclusion may be correct, but the provided argument is incomplete, hand-wavy, or lacks sufficient rigor.
	*  **Procedure:**
		* Explain the gap in the justification.
		* State that you will **assume the step’s conclusion is true** for the sake of argument.
		* Then, proceed to verify all subsequent steps to check if the remainder of the argument is sound.

**3. Output Format**
Your response MUST be structured into two main sections: a **Summary** followed by the **Detailed Verification Log**.

*   **a. Summary**
	This section MUST be at the very beginning of your response. It must contain two components:
	*  **Final Verdict**: A single, clear sentence declaring the overall validity of the solution. For example: "The solution is correct," "The solution contains a Critical Error and is therefore invalid," or "The solution’s approach is viable but contains several Justification Gaps."
	*  **List of Findings**: A bulleted list that summarizes **every** issue you discovered. For each finding, you must provide:
		*   **Location:** A direct quote of the key phrase or equation where the issue occurs.
		*   **Issue:** A brief description of the problem and its classification (**Critical Error** or **Justification Gap**).

*   **b. Detailed Verification Log**
	Following the summary, provide the full, step-by-step verification log as defined in the Core Instructions. When you refer to a specific part of the solution, **quote the relevant text** to make your reference clear before providing your detailed analysis of that part.

**Example of the Required Summary Format**
*This is a generic example to illustrate the required format. Your findings must be based on the actual solution provided below.*

**Final Verdict:** The solution is **invalid** because it contains a Critical Error.

**List of Findings:**
*   **Location:** "By interchanging the limit and the integral, we get ..."
	*   **Issue:** Justification Gap - The solution interchanges a limit and an integral without providing justification, such as proving uniform convergence.
*   **Location: **"From $A > B$ and $C > D$, it follows that $A−C>B−D$"
	*	**Issue:** Critical Error - This step is a logical fallacy. Subtracting inequalities in this manner is not a valid mathematical operation.
